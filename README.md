## Project Description
Our project aims to create a solution for students at the University of Washington experiencing food insecurity. Our solution will decrease the exploitation of student funds and improve student life by varying food choices through connecting with more partners. This will include additional food ventors (ie. restaurants on the Ave). 

## Repository Details
This repository includes reference to a back-end database (PostgreSQL or MS SQL Server) that stores all the transaction and login information. Both vendors and students will be able to login to the service and view their financial information.
